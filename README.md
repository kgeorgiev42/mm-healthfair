This repository holds code for the Understanding Fairness and Explainability in Multimodal Approaches within Healthcare project.
See the [original project propsoal](https://nhsx.github.io/nhsx-internship-projects/advances-modalities-explainability/) for more information.

_**Note:** Only public or fake data are shared in this repository._

### Project Stucture

- The main code is found in the root of the repository (see Usage below for more information)
- The accompanying [report](./reports/report.pdf) is also available in the `reports` folder
- More information about the code usage can be found in the [model card](./model_card.md)

### Built With

[![Python v3.10](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.10-blue)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

### Getting Started

#### Installation

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

To clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/nhsengland/mm-healthfair`

To create a suitable environment:

1. Use pip + requirements.txt
- ```python -m venv _env```
- `source _env/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Use poetry (*recommended*)
- Install poetry (see [website](https://python-poetry.org) for documentation)
- Navigate to project root directory `cd mm-healthfair`
- Create environment from poetry lock file: `poetry install`
- Run scripts using `poetry run python3 xxx.py`

### Usage
This repository contains code used to extract and preprocess demographic, time-series and clinical notes from MIMIC-IV v2.2. Additionally, it includes the model architectures and training scripts used to train multimodal models on different modalities and generate the results described in the report.

#### Outputs
- Preprocessed features from MIMIC-IV 2.2
- Trained models
- Notebook exploring the dataset and visualising results

Seeds have been set to reproduce the results in the report.

#### Datasets
The MIMIC-IV dataset (v2.2) can be downloaded from [PhysioNet.org](https://physionet.org). This project made use of three modules:
- Hosp: hospital level data for patients: labs, micro, and electronic medication administration
- ED: data from the emergency department
- Notes: deidentified free-text clinical notes

Further information can be found in PhysioNet's [documentation](https://mimic.mit.edu/).
